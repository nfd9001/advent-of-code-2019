 Solutions to Advent Of Code 2019

These are my solutions to AoC 2019. I didn't necessarily go for
highest-possible-elegance or the leaderboards (in fact, I started late), so
don't be surprised if my solutions look a little long, have inconsistent
indentation, have snippets of dead code left in.... I've mostly left these
submissions looking the way they did when I submitted the correct answer.
